[.lead]
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this SaltStack Formula! We greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before you submit any pull requests or issues. It will help us work together more effectively. We follow a fairly standard {uri-pr-help}[pull request process] for contributions, subject to the following guidelines.

NOTE: We have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

== What to expect when you contribute

When you submit a pull request, our team is notified and will respond as quickly as we can. We'll do our best to work with you to ensure that your pull request adheres to our style and standards. If we merge your pull request, we might make additional edits later for style or clarity.

== File a GitHub issue

Before starting any work, we recommend filing a GitHub issue in this repo. This is a great chance to ask questions and get feedback from the maintainers and the community before you sink a lot of time into writing (possibly the wrong) code. If there is anything you're unsure about, just ask!

== Update the documentation

We recommend updating the documentation *before* updating any code (see {uri-tpw}[Readme Driven Development]). This ensures the documentation stays up to date and allows you to think through the problem at a high level before you get lost in the weeds of coding.

== Update the tests

We also recommend updating the automated tests *before* updating any code (see {uri-tdd}[Test Driven Development]). That means you add or update a test case, verify that it's failing with a clear error message, and *then* make the code changes to get that test to pass. This ensures the tests stay up to date and verify all the functionality in this formula, including whatever new functionality you're adding in your contribution.

== Update the code

At this point, make your code changes and use your new test case to verify that everything is working. As you work, keep in mind two things:

. Backward compatibility
. Downtime

=== Backward compatibility

Please make every effort to avoid unnecessary backwards incompatible changes. With SaltStack code, this means:

- Do not delete, rename, or change the type of input variables.
- If you add an input variable, it should have a `default`.
- Do not delete or rename a folder in the formula.

If a backwards incompatible change cannot be avoided, please make sure to call that out when you submit a pull request, explaining why the change is absolutely necessary.

=== Downtime

Bear in mind that the SaltStack code in this formula is used by real companies to manage real infrastructure in production, and certain types of changes could cause downtime. For example, consider the following:

. If you rename a variable (e.g. `aws_instance_foo` -> `aws_instance_bar`), A user will be unaware and have `aws_instance_foo` set in saltclass data.
. If you change certain attributes of a resource (e.g. the `name` of an `aws_elb`), the cloud provider (e.g. AWS) may treat that as an instruction to delete the old resource and a create a new one.

Deleting certain types of resources (e.g. virtual servers, load balancers) can cause downtime, so when making code changes, think carefully about how to avoid that. If  downtime cannot be avoided, please make sure to call that out when you submit a pull request.

== Create a pull request

{uri-pr-help}[Create a pull request] with your changes. Please make sure to include the following:

. A description of the change, including a link to your GitHub issue.
. The output of your automated test run, preferably in a {uri-gist}[GitHub Gist]. We cannot run automated tests for pull requests automatically due to {uri-travis}[security concerns], so we need you to manually provide this test output so we can verify that everything is working.
. Any notes on backwards incompatibility or downtime.

== Merge and release

The maintainers for this repo will review your code and provide feedback. If everything looks good, they will merge the code and release a new version, which you'll be able to find in the {uri-releases}[releases page].
